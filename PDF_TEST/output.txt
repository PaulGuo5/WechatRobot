H. Rider Haggard
Works by the English writer H. Rider Haggard consist largely of adventure fiction, but also of non-fiction. The
eighth child of a Norfolk barrister and squire, through family connections he gained employment with Sir Henry
Bulwer during the latter's service as lieutenant-governor of Natal, South Africa. Rider Haggard travelled to
southern Africa in 1875 and remained in the country for six years, during which time he served as Master of the
High Court of the Transvaal and an adjutant of the Pretoria Horse. Rider Haggard's time in Africa proved
inspirational for him. He returned to Britain in 1881 and was called to the bar; while studying he wrote his first
book, Cetywayo and His White Neighbours, a critical examination of Britain's policies in South Africa. In 1885 he
wrote one of his most popular novels, King Solomon's Mines—detailing the life of the adventurer Allan
Quatermain—which was followed by She: A History of Adventure (1886), which introduced the female character
Ayesha; both characters became the focus of series of books. According to the author Morton N. Cohen, writing
for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, much of Rider Haggard's reputation rests on these two works.
